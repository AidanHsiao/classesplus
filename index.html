	<p>Welcome to the official classes+ website! Classes+ is an extension of my other datapack, classes, which adds special classes that are exclusive to one person. Each class is tailored for a specific type of person, with each class having either one passive or and one active or two active abilities. Each class also comes with an "ultimate" move, which is a special move that is quite strong and has a long cooldown. To go to the original classes site, click the <strong style="color:mediumaquamarine">classes</strong> link at the top. Below are the previous patch notes of classes+.</p><br>
	<button class="patchNotes" onclick="extend112()">Classes+ v1.1.2<div id="symbol112">+</div></button>

	<button class="patchNotes" onclick="extend111()">Classes+ v1.1.1<div id="symbol111">+</div></button>
	<div class="patchNotesContent" id="111">- Minor bug fixes to Raijin Shinobi class<br><br>- Homing arrows fix (would constantly summon more underground to compensate for lack of no gravity)</div><br>
	
	<button class="patchNotes" onclick="extend110()">Classes+ v1.1.0<div id="symbol110">+</div></button>
	<div class="patchNotesContent" id="110"><strong>New class: Raijin Shinobi class!</strong><br><br>- This class features two different themes/modes: Raijin mode, and Shadow mode. Raijin is the japanese god of thunder, and so by request of one of my friends, mixed it with a ninja-style class! When in Raijin mode, the weapon used is the Fang of the Thunder God (10 base damage, when hit enemies strikes all entities in 10 block radius), and when in Shadow mode, the weapon used is the Fang of the Midnight Shinobi (20 base damage). <br>- In Shadow mode, you get Speed X, and in Raijin mode, you get Speed V.<br>- ULTIMATE (only usable in Raijin mode): Fury of the Thunder God: summons a tornado that sucks in nearby mobs, then rains lightning in a 50 block radius! Being hit by the lightning will result in instant death. Lightning will target highest ground in that area (spreadplayer command).</div><br>
	
	<button class="patchNotes" onclick="extend104()">Classes+ v1.0.4<div id="symbol104">+</div></button>
	<div class="patchNotesContent" id="104"><strong>New classes in progress: Dragon Sin and The Gamer!</strong><br><br>- Each class is unique from the rest due to class-exclusive abilities.<br><br>- For "The Gamer", you can learn abilities using experience points, and your buffs are based upon your experience level.<br><br>- For "Dragon Sin", the special ability is Unleashed Counter. To activate this passive, you need to take damage while sneaking. When the damage is taken, you'll be healed to full health and food.<br><br>- After no longer sneaking, all entities in a 10 block radius will be struck by lightning and instantly die. The user is then given speed, jump boost and strength V that all last for 10 seconds.<br><br>- Keep in mind that these classes are in-progress and do not have active abilities or ultimates.</div><br>
	
	<button class="patchNotes" onclick="extend103()">Classes+ v1.0.3<div id="symbol103">+</div></button>
	<div class="patchNotesContent" id="103"><strong>New classes in concept: Archmage!</strong><br><br>- The Archmage class is unique in that you level up as you use your abilities. Each ability, or tome in this case, is dropped, instead of right-clicked: making the item representative of what it would actually be (a book instead of carrots on sticks lmao). When a certain tome is used a certain number of times, that tome is upgraded to a stronger version. Tomes come in ten tiers. Please note that this class doesn't possess any abilities so far.<br><br>- Minor bug fixes to existing classes.</div><br>
	
	<button class="patchNotes" onclick="extend102()">Classes+ v1.0.2<div id="symbol102">+</div></button>
	<div class="patchNotesContent" id="102"><strong>Ability revamp: Dash/Accelerate</strong><br><br>- Instead of teleporting the user behind a certain enemy, the ability now has a shortened cooldown and teleports the user in 20 blocks in the direction they are looking. The spot they will teleport to is marked by particles, and particles appear at the previous location when teleporting.<br><br>- Minor bug fixes to Magic Archer class.<br><br>- Fixed homing arrow AI.</div><br>
	
	<button class="patchNotes" onclick="extend101()">Classes+ v1.0.1<div id="symbol101">+</div></button>
	<div class="patchNotesContent" id="101"><strong>New class in progress: Magic Archer!</strong><br><br>- The Magic Archer is special because they fire arrows that naturally home towards the nearest enemy. Not only that, arrows the approach the magic archer are turned into homing arrows and no longer possess the capability of naturally harming the user. The ultimate, Lightning Hailstorm, summons 4 waves of arrows, with more details in documentation.<br><br>- Buffed Dark Sorcerer rage (IV to V effect amplifiers).</div><br>
	
	<button class="patchNotes" onclick="extend100()">Classes+ v1.0.0<div id="symbol100">+</div></button>
	<div class="patchNotesContent" id="100"><strong>New classes: Dark Sorcerer and Shadow Spectre!</strong><br><br>- These two classes share some similarities, such as dash, and held abilities. The Shadow Spectre gievs the user invisibility and speed, while Dark Sorcerer gives the user strength and resistance. However, a major difference is in their ultimates. The Shadow Spectre's ability focuses more on killing, while the Dark Sorcerer's ability focuses more on sheer damage and destructive capability (keep in mind neither do block damage, and nothing will).</div><br>
